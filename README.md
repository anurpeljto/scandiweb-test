# Anur Peljto Junior FullStack Web Developer Submission

Hi scandiweb recuriting team, this is my submission for the junior fullstack position. I've done my best to follow your test guide and rules, and I hope that you will like this application. Some things may not be as requested in the guidelines, namely some of the data-testid attributes, because I was experimenting with the QA Tester tool (to make it work for me). One such example could be the cart overlay, which I've made related to the gray overlay of the main screen, as opposed to the actual cart overlay (the cart). 

NOTE: I have also made the design responsive, and I would like to encourage you to try the website out on mobile devices or small resolutions as well! 

NOTE 2: I haven't used ENV variables for my database, so that if you should want or need to, you can access and see the database as well. 

It has been a very fun and exciting project, and I hope that in the future I can continue to learn and improve as a member of the Scandiweb team.
